What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I need it to create the repository itself. It creates the .git dirctory and its
contents and prepare it to work.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different than the working directory since it is not a
directory - it is a logical area for preparing the files to be committed.
The value it offers is that with the help of the staging area I can add several
files to a single commit and can review all the relevant files before commiting
them.
