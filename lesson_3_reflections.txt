When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would like to use remote repository when i would like to use the cloud
benefits:
When I want to backup my local repository, when I want to work from several
machines and when I want some users would be able to use the repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I always want to pull changes manually becuase i would like to have control on
the commits i pull to my local one. I should control my merging as well.
